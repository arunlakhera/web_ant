This project will be very useful for logistics companies, where on a day-to-day basis a lot of couriers, packages, or goods are transported via different modes of transport. The main concern with these logistics companies is trying to deliver these goods in an efficient and cost-efficient way possible, so the pricing of the shipment is tricky and involves a lot of variables to consider while the pricing of the shipment. There might be scenarios where the shipment might be delayed due to some external reasons, leading to a loss for the company and a delay in delivery of the shipment. So logistics companies need to use dynamic pricing based on several factors and variables to price the shipment in such a way that there are no losses to the company and the price of the shipment is as less as possible so that customers can use their services more due to effective pricing rates.",
